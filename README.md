# My personal Neovim config
This my personal config for [NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim). I built it from scratch using Lua and [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) as my package manager. Below are some screenshots of my config as well as a table that lists all the extensions that I installed.
